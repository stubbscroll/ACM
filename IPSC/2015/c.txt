/* solution for chess pieces, both inputs
   algorithm: find a chess game, and play both sides. for example:
   http://www.apronus.com/chess/wbeditor.php

   easy: we need more than 8 of a single piece, which means we have to promote
   either 8 queens, or 7 rooks/bishops/knights, while keeping the ones we
   start with. this is straightforward, just avoid accidentally checkmating/
   stalemating the opponent.

   hard: the upper bound is 20 rooks: the 4 we start with, and 8 pawns from
   each side that can be promoted. it turns out it can be achieved. for each
   column, one of the pawns must capture to get into another column with no
   blocking pawn. 8 captures is sufficient. it's messier than the nice booklet
   solution, since i do it in an ad-hoc fashion but it works.
